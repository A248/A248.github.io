## Developer Resources

### Maven Repository

All projects are deployed to one of these repositories, depending on the license:

```
https://mvn-repo.arim.space/lesser-gpl3/
https://mvn-repo.arim.space/gpl3/
https://mvn-repo.arim.space/affero-gpl3/
```

See specific projects for `groupId`, `artifactId`, and `version` values. These fields are found in a project's `pom.xml`.

### Javadocs

The javadocs are attached to each artifact. Any IDE which recognises maven dependencies and can download attached sources/javadocs is able to fetch such documentation.

## Justification of Free Software

*Put simply, software may be copied at no cost to the developer. It is the logical that it be sold at no price.*

The basic economics of software are as follows:

For any unit of software, there is a fixed initial cost to develop it, but beyond that, the marginal cost of production is zero. Thus software is said to be non-rival in consumption. Therefore it is right that no price be charged for software, since the net marginal benefit on each unit distributed is always positive, so long as the software is itself a good.

The good of man is to be in accordance with reason. With regards to software, this is realised as described, for all software which is in its own a good.

## Licensing

Some projects use the LGPL, some the GPL, some the AGPL. Always see the license file located in the project directory for more information.
